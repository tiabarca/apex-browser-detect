# apex-browser-detect<br>
<B>A plugin made to detect minimal browser requeriments for apex v20.x.</b> <br>
Recently I developed an apex webapp for a client that has a lot of outdated pcs with old browsers. Users are not allowed to update it due to IT policies.<br>
The issues reported for these cases were crazy: errors on validating nulls, login, calculated fields, etc...<br>
We made this plugin to simplify the task for check  browser requeriments.</P>
<b>Ussage&Install:</b> <br>
<ul>
<li>1-Install plugin</li>
<li>2-On desired page create a onpageload Dynamic-Action</li>
<li>3-Add plugin to true action, it works with predefined standards, but you could change minimum version for most used browsers or disable less used browsers.</li>
<li>4-Enjoy ;-)</li>
</ul>
